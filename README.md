# Getting Started

HELLO!!!!! and Welcome to Bamboozled. I am your host Jake Armijo. It is a honor and pleasure to be here with you this evening.

Let's have our First contestant step right up.

$ git clone https://github.com/jakearmijo/Tandemapprenticeship.git

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000]to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Assumptions

• A round of trivia has 10 Questions
• All questions are multiple-choice questions
• Your score does not need to update in real time
• Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
• We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

### Things I would improve or Add

• Firstly I would have spent more time on testing. I know that it is important and I just dove into the code to create as much as I could. JEST seems to be really unique and effective.
• Complete a back end to have more questions and maybe allow users to submit their own questions for approval and use.
• Styling. I would like to look more sleek and sexy.
• Top / fasest scores. Since there are only 20 it be cool to see how fast a user could get as many correct in the shorest amount of time.
